For this project I was given a lawnmower to dissasemble and perform a fluid mechanical analysis on. We began this process by seperating the engine from the body and the blade of the lawnmower. We then removed the air filter casing and the carburator, and examined the choke and throttle. We then removed the header and inspected the piston, cylinder, and valves as we rotated the crankshaft. Finally, we took off the muffler and looked inside of it. [A video of this dissection]( "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMR9_IDpstQ" ) is available here.

My responsibilities for this project included leading the dissasembly of the engine, and drawing a diagram of how our system worked. I also collaberated with my teammates to make sure our video comprehensively explained the functionality of an engine and ensured everyone understood how things worked.
