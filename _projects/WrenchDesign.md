For this project I was assigned the job of designing, CAD modeling, and using ANSYS to analyze a wrench. I had to meet criteria for torque procuced, load point deflection, max normal stress, safety factor for strength, safety factor for crack growth, and safety factor for fatigue. I also had to pick a strain gauge and place it at a position on the wrench that would produce an allowed range of strain values. 

To do this, I controlled variables such as length, width, and thickness of the wrench, distance between the drive and the strain gauge, and the material used. I then used these specifications to make a CAD model in Fusion, and used ANSYS to verify that the design would survive the forces applied
