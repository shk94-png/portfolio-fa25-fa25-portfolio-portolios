## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/SamKuzmishinHeadshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Sam Kuzmishin, and I am a Junior Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. I am interested in Aerospace and Automotive engineering, as well as mechanical design. I am a member of Cornell Mars Rover, a student run enginering project team on campus, where I work to design, analyze, manufacture, and test our suspension before an annual competition in Utah. I also founded and operate Drive On, a nonprofit orginization dedicated to providing affordable and reliable transportation to the Pittsburgh community. This involves fundraising money to purchase car parts, and working with other local nonprofits to find individuals who need assistance.
